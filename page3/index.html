            <h2>Patent Pending</h2>
            <p>
                This is the building in which Nikola Tesla lived and performed his
                experiments on radio waves, transmitting them to his laboratory near
                present day Trinity Church in downtown Manhattan. The ‘waves’ which
                guided you here (GPS) and surround you now (WiFi) were envisioned by
                Tesla more than a century ago. Born during a lightning storm, Nikola
                Tesla was a child of light. An immigrant, an innovator and a patriot,
                Tesla dreamed of a world which few others could imagine. He was an
                eccentric genius, an ‘Electric Messiah’. We toast to him and the
                countless others that think outside the box, persevering against all
                odds.

            <h2>Death & Co.</h2>
            <p>
                Opened on New Year's Eve 2006/07 in Manhattan's East Village, Death & Co
                quickly became a cocktail institution, owed greatly to our staff of
                creative bartenders and incredible servers. Since then, we have evolved
                and changed; from an intimate bar in NYC to a sprawling cocktail lounge
                and restaurant in Denver.
