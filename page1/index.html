        <h2>Gin Tonic</h2>
        <p>A gin and tonic or, less frequently, gin tonic is a highball cocktail made with gin and tonic water poured over a large amount of ice. ... The ice cools the gin, dulling the effect of the alcohol in the mouth and making the drink more pleasant to taste.</p>

        <h2>Manhattan</h2>
        <p>The Manhattan was the most famous cocktail in the world shortly after it was invented in New York Cityâ€™s Manhattan Club, some time around 1880 (as the story goes).
