# project1
This project is part of my development as software developer, using the following technologies: HTML, JS and CSS.
The whole idea of this project was to show the basic use of html elements, such as semantic tags, links to other pages and images.
I also used CSS to provide basic styling and to use basic selector properly. I choose a topic that i thought it would be fun to develop in the future.
Please don't hesitate to provide feedback. Thanks
